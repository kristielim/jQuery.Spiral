Options = {
Radius: numeric (pixels), horizontal distance between starting and final points;
Duration: number of milliseconds (as for animate) ;
Easing: the number of cicles - if it is higher than 2 it will make more turns and will assume a 'bouncing' deceleration effect
Queue: boolean (as for animate) ;
Ydirection: boolean. If true, the rotation starts going up instead of down.
Xdirection: boolean. If true the movement will be from left to the right, instead of right to left.
InsideOut: boolean. If true, the object will whirl out from the inside of the spiral. Note that setting it to true changes the sense of Xdirection ;
Vertical: boolean. If true, the object spiral will be primarily vertical.
},
Callback = function called when the animation ends (as for animate) ;
